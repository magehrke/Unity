# Unity
This repository contains `serious games` made with `Unity`. Each game has the focus on a specific aspect. I developed these games as part of my Serious Games lecture at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. To get to know unity I would recommend to start with the tutorials on the unity website. The first game requires few knowledge, the last game the most. Have a look around or just enjoy playing.
